# PWA-To-Do-App
This is a **To-Do Progressive Web Application** which uses the local storage of a browser to store user's tasks. This app can also be **installed** on user's device which gives the feeling of a **normal native app**. The tasks are stored on the **browser's local storage** which means this app is even accessible in the **offline mode**. This app is also **responsive** and works well with desktops, laptops and mobile devices.

## Steps to run the app locally
> Assuming you already have Git and NPM installed on your system and know how to use command prompt/terminal.
* Open command prompt (or terminal) and change the current working directory to location where you want to clone the repository.
* Then type: *git clone https://github.com/OptimalLearner/PWA-To-Do-App.git*
* If the clone was successfully completed then a new sub directory may appear with the same name as the repository.
* Now change the currently directory to the new sub directory.
* Install http server using this command: *npm install --global http-server*
* Then simply run the http-server using this command: *http-server*
* Now you can access the app on http://localhost:8080/
